# Mobile-Programming-Task-1

<b>Description:</b> 
Project is built for Android platform using <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/"><i>Cordova</i></a>. <i>www</i> folder contains all the edited files. 
Built version can be tested on Android devices by installing the .apk file

<b>Process:</b>
The app uses cordova's own camera API. <i>EventHandlers</i> are binded to buttons and call the needed functions of class <i>Camera</i>

<b>References: </b>
During the implementation <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-camera/index.html">Cordova docs</a> were used as the main source of information. There is a noticable lack of tutorials and unofficial materials concering Cordova and I must say that docs are not the best ones :V
